We have IntelliJ as IDE. If you have IntelliJ, it should run smoothly without the need  of adding anything else. We have used H2 database, you also have to have the database running.

About H2:
1.Download it from here - http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html
2.Go to the bin folder, run the h2w file.
3.It will open a tab in your default browser. Log in with username and password - the default is "sa" and password is blank.We have used the default username and password in the project.
4.You're ready to go!
